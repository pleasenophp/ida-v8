# Ida Core on V8

This code provides core support logic, runtime and libraries to integrate the Google V8 engine into your custom application. It's designed primarily for the games, allowing to implement the story or modding scripting engine in JS.

The code below is not supposed to work out of the box, and requires some effort for the integration. You can find the examples of ready integrations
in the other open source projects, for example in [IdaJS](https://ida.innerbytes.com).
